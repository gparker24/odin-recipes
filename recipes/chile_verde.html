        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A mexican chile made with pork and roasted peppers that is sure to warm your bones on a cold winter day.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1-1/2 pounds fresh tomatillos, or more to taste, husks removed</li>
            <li>3 serrano peppers</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons lard or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 pounds pork shoulder, or more to taste, trimmed and cut into 1.5-inch cubes</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup red wine</li>
            <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken stock</li>
            <li>1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>reheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Combine tomatillos, serrano peppers, and garlic in a bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and toss to coat. Transfer to a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Place in the preheated oven and roast until tender, about 30 minutes. Remove vegetables from oven, cool slightly, and transfer to the bowl of a food processor. Puree until smooth. Reduce oven temperature to 275 degrees F.</li>
            <li>While vegetables are roasting, heat lard in a Dutch oven or heavy oven-safe pot over medium-high heat. Sprinkle pork with garlic salt and pepper and add to the pot in batches. Cook each batch until browned, about 7 minutes, removing to a plate with a slotted spoon. Drain and discard all but 2 tablespoons pan drippings.</li>
            <li>Add onion and bell pepper to the pot. Saut√©, stirring occasionally, until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour wine into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Stir in browned pork, tomatillo puree, chicken stock, cilantro, oregano, cumin, and salt.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook in the oven until pork is tender, 3.5 to 4 hours. Allow to stand for 15 minutes, covered, before serving.</li>
        </ol>
